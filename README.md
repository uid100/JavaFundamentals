4. Expand the project in the package explorer and find the 2 .java files below the src folder.

### Complete the Assignment
1. Run the **Test** file (`TestM1Challenge.java`) and add the code to the source file
(`M1Challenge.java`) until the tests are successful.
3. Uncomment each test case in the test file, one at a time. Do not modify the content 
in this file except to uncomment the tests. Modify the code (in `M1Challenge.java`) as
